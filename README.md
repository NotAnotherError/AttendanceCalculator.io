# AttendanceCalculator

Webpage: notanothererror.github.io/AttendanceCalculator.io/


 Calculate your attendance percentages on the fly.
Meant for places that calculate in a decimal format,
If yours are not in a decimal format just take the hours as they are,
Then take the minutes and divide by 60, so 3h30m => 3.5 hrs
